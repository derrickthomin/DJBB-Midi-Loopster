# DJBB-Midi-Loopster

The Midi Loopster is a MIDI 4x4 drum pad and midi looper based on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Background
I created the [DJBB Arcade Button MIDI Drumpad](https://github.com/derrickthomin/djbb-midi-box) as an experiment on how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller as a Midi controller.

It worked pretty well but I honestly don't like the super loud arcade buttons so I never really used it. I wanted an excuse to try designing my first PCB, so I decided to go for a version two of my original design except with these changes:

- Use Cherry style key switches for the buttons (quieter but still feel nice. Also smaller)

- Uses a custom PCB for max compactness and ease of build

- Switch out controls for a function button and encoder

- Firmware re-write

## Assembly
[See my guide here](https://www.djbajablast.com/post/djbb-midi-loopster) for in depth assembly instructions.

In short:
- Solder the fn button and top left pad to the front of the board. You must do this first!! These are the top-leftmost buttons.
- Solder everything else (The pico, aux, and 2 resistors go on the back).
- Follow [Adafruit's guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython?gclid=CjwKCAjw6p-oBhAYEiwAgg2PghND96Zkn-Pus4noFSVOym_cpsFfdWGF-w9weuVSVz8qTd52cKaOGBoCJ0QQAvD_BwE) for installing CircuitPython on your Pico

## Firmware Upload (use this to update as well)
- Delete everything from the Pico on your computer (should be showing up as a USB drive on your computer).
- Download and copy everything from "src" in this repo to the Pico

## Usage
See "djbb loopster manual.pdf" in this repo.

I also sell PCBs/Kits here if ya want: https://djbajablast.etsy.com
